# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LAMP STACK) IN AWS

## Introduction:

## What is a LAMP stack?
A LAMP stack is a bundle of four different software technologies that developers use to build websites and web applications. LAMP is an acronym for the operating system, Linux; the web server, Apache; the database server, MySQL; and the programming language, PHP. All four of these technologies are open source, which means they are community maintained and freely available for anyone to use. Developers use LAMP stacks to create, host, and maintain.

## Why is a LAMP stack important?

Web developers choose a LAMP stack to build web applications for the following reasons. 
Cost
All LAMP technologies are open source, which means that any developer or company can use them without having to pay licensing fees. Instead of purchasing proprietary stack components, you can download the operating system, web server, database, and scripting language for free. This lowers the cost of building web applications.
Efficiency
Setting up a new web development stack requires rigorous testing of different frameworks, modules, libraries, and tools. On the other hand, a LAMP stack is a tried-and-tested web development solution. Web developers can prioritize and speed up application development to focus on what they are building instead of how they are building it.
Maintenance
Software experts from around the globe contribute to the development of LAMP stack technologies by changing, commenting on, and reviewing the publicly available source codes. They regularly maintain and update the technologies so that they remain relevant and secure. 
Support
Popular open-source technologies, such as LAMP stacks, have the support of a large, global IT community. Hence, LAMP stack users can more easily find information on public IT forums. Web developers can refer to example codes or use tested plugins created by the open-source community. 
Flexibility
A LAMP stack gives both reliability and flexibility to web developers. While the LAMP architecture specifies the software components for each layer, developers can replace them as they see fit. For example, they can use another operating system besides Linux as the stack foundation.
What is a LAMP stack used for?
A LAMP stack is used for backend or server-side development. A backend application is software that runs in an environment that’s hidden from end users. Backend applications consist of the following:
-	Data processing software 
- Database components
- Business logic in code 
- API for communicating with other applications 

The webpage that shows up on your browser is called the frontend application. When you interact with the page, such as by clicking on a button, your browser communicates with the backend application to retrieve the required information.
Developers use a LAMP stack to create both static and dynamic web content.

## What is Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond. This methodology outlines a series of steps that divide the software development process into tasks you can assign, complete, and measure.

## Why is SDLC important?
Software development can be challenging to manage due to changing requirements, technology upgrades, and cross-functional collaboration. The software development lifecycle (SDLC) methodology provides a systematic management framework with specific deliverables at every stage of the software development process. As a result, all stakeholders agree on software development goals and requirements upfront and also have a plan to achieve those goals.

Here are some benefits of SDLC:
-	Increased visibility of the development process for all stakeholders involved
- Efficient estimation, planning, and scheduling
-  Improved risk management and cost estimation
- Systematic software delivery and better customer satisfaction

## What are TCP and UDP?

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, meaning that it requires an established connection before data can be transmitted between two locations. In addition, TCP features built-in systems that look for errors and guarantee that data gets delivered in the same order it’s sent.
However, TCP eats up bandwidth, a price you pay for sending and receiving web pages, images, and data files.
On the other hand, UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol, a more straightforward, connectionless Internet protocol that doesn't need error-checking and recovery services. UDP has no overhead for opening, maintaining, or terminating a connection. UDP continuously sends data to the recipient, regardless of whether they get it or not.
Although UDP isn’t the best choice for sending an e-mail, looking at a webpage, or downloading files, it’s great for real-time communications such as broadcast or multitasked network transmissions.


## Commonly Used Ports in Web

1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - Port 80
2.	HTTPS (HTTP Secure) - Port 443
3.	SSH (Secure Shell) - Port 22
4.	FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - Port 21
5.	Telnet - Port 23
6.	SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) - Port 22
